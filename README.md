# UniPac: Unicode-powered Pacman Adventure 

Pacman for the terminal. Controls are on the arrow keys.

Has most of the game elements from the original game:
* Ghosts go through Shuffle and Chase (lightbulb) periods where they respectively ignore and actively target pacman.
* Ghosts slow down in the tunnel and when freightened.
* When eaten, ghost eyes trace path back to ghost house.
* Two 'fruit' bonuses on every level.
